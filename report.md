## Assessment of Our Team's Way of Working based on the Essence Framework:

Our team’s way of working is currently between In Use and In Place. 
At the beginning, we agreed on basic principles and constraints, such as using GitHub with linked issues, a Kanban-style board, and Discord for communication. 
We selected and set up enough tools and practices to start and complete the work within the very short project duration. 
All team members use the shared repository and the agreed tools, even though we have different experience levels, working speeds, and personal IDE preferences. 
Overall, the way of working supports collaboration and progress, as most parts of the assignment were implemented and tested on time. 
However, it does not work completly flawless yet. 
Communication about availability and time commitment was sometimes unclear, which led to delays and last-minute work before the presentation. 
This shows that a way of working is established and used, but it has not yet stabilised enough to be considered working well. 
To reach the next state, clearer task division at the start and more explicit communication about time availability would be helpful.
